Project: Guess the Number Game

<p>Guess the Number Game is a simple web-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. 
After each guess, the game provides feedback indicating whether the secret number is higher or lower than the player's guess. The player can see the number of attempts and a history of all previous guesses.
The interface features a light orange background for a warm, playful feel, and it's also my favorite color, a green "Guess" button for action emphasis, and an easy-to-read card layout. A “New Game” button allows players to start over at any time. 
This project demonstrates basic front-end skills, including user input handling, conditional logic, DOM manipulation, and responsive styling.</p>
